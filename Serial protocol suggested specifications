Serial protocol suggested specifications
Each call or response will be terminated by a newline
Each call or response will begin with a single ASCII letter and possibly ASCII-encoded integers
A more verbose protocol could be implemented, but this is chosen because of the memory limitations of the Arduino

A successfully implemented call will be signaled by a response of "A" for Acknowledge

Configuration:
    "C0" read configuration values
        receives packet matching config write
        send ACK on receipt of values
    "C1 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]" write config values (also response to config read request)
        [1] number of players (3)
        [2] timeout in milliseconds after buzz-in (3000)
        [3] lockout period in milliseconds for buzz-in before answer-enable (750)
        [4] timeout for no response after answer-enable (4000)
        [5]     bit0: enable verbose lights (1)
                bit1: enable buzzer on answer-enable (1)
                bit2: enable speaker on answer-enable (1)
                bit3: allow second try answers (1)
                bit4: allow third try answers (1)
                bit4:7 future
        [6] hardware (1) or software (0) control of answer-enable (default 0)
            hardware control currently requires 3 or fewer players
            I may add more buttons to the control panel, but we'll do them on a keyboard/monitor for now
        [7] resend timeout on no response of ACK (50)

Signaling:
    "E" answer-Enable (sent by computer or implemented by button press of control unit)
    "S [1]" Signaling event (sent by control unit)
        [1] player number who buzzed in first
    "R [1]" response to question (sent by computer)
        [1] boolean value as to correctness of answer, will retrigger answer-Enable if configured for second/third try answers
        will also trigger speaker/buzzer/light events
        should be sent within timeout "C [2]" for best effect
    "T [1]" timeout event (sent by control unit)
        [1] type of timeout
            1: timeout after buzz-in with no answer
            2: timeout after answer-enable with no answer
